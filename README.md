# Turnly
Turnly is a mobile app that allows customers to join queues remotely and helps businesses manage walk-ins and appointments efficiently in real time.

## Overview
Turnly solves the problem of wasted waiting time in businesses like salons, clinics, and service desks. Customers can join a queue remotely, see their estimated wait time, and receive notifications when they are next. Businesses can manage queues, call the next customer, and monitor daily activity—all from their admin dashboard.

A fully functional Flutter app with:
